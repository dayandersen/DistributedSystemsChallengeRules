# DistributedSystemsChallengeRules
The rules for a March 2024 event. The goal of this will be to finish all challenges from FlyIO Dist System challenge by the end of the month.

Basic steps:
1. All contestants need to create a private repo, and provide me (dayandersen) access to view this.
2. Code each challenge in its own module/package/crate so that each can be runnable after moving to the next challenge.
3. Upload a screenshot to your repo demonstrating success in each module.
4. At the end of March I will check to see who has gotten the furthest in this challenge, and who completed each challenge first. Completion % will be prioritzed over time, so whoever gets the furthest will be ranked higher than who finished first. The top 3 winners will be provided with a custom T-Shirt for competing.
